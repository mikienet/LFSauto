#        8.35. Libtool-2.4.6  
# 
#                          The Libtool package contains the GNU generic library support script. It wraps the
#                        complexity of using shared libraries in a consistent, portable interface. 
#           Approximate build time: 1.6 SBU
#           Required disk space: 43 MB
#          8.35.1. Installation of Libtool 
# 
#                          Prepare Libtool for compilation: 



./configure --prefix=/usr



# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          To test the results, issue: 



make check



#          Note 
# 
#                          The test time for libtool can be reduced significantly on a system with multiple
#                        cores. To do this, append  TESTSUITEFLAGS=-j<N> to the line above. For instance, using
#                        -j4 can reduce the test time by over 60 percent. 
# 
#                          Five tests are known to fail in the LFS build environment due to a circular dependency,
#                        but all tests pass if rechecked after automake is installed. 
# 
#                          Install the package:

# 
#                          The GDBM package contains the GNU Database Manager. It is a library of database
#                        functions that use extensible hashing and works similar to the standard UNIX dbm.
#                        The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs, searching and retrieving
#                        the data by its key and deleting a key along with its data.

# 
#                          The meaning of the configure options: 
# 
#                --disable-logger 
# 
#                          This option prevents Inetutils from installing the  logger program, which is used
#                        by scripts to pass messages to the System Log Daemon. Do not install it because
#                        Util-linux installs a more recent version.

# 
#                --disable-r*

#          8.40.1. Installation of Perl 
# 
#                          This version of Perl now builds the Compress::Raw::Zlib and Compress::Raw::BZip2
#                        modules. By default Perl will use an internal copy of the sources for the build.
#                        Issue the following command so that Perl will use the libraries installed on the
#                        system: 



export BUILD_ZLIB=False
export BUILD_BZIP2=0



# 
#                          To have full control over the way Perl is set up, you can remove the "-des"options
#                        from the following command and hand-pick the way this package is built. Alternatively,
#                        use the command exactly as below to use the defaults that Perl auto-detects:

# 
#                          The meaning of the configure options: 
# 
#                -Dvendorprefix=/usr 
# 
#                          This ensures  perl knows how to tell packages where they should install their perl
#                        modules. 
# 
#                -Dpager="/usr/bin/less -isR" 
# 
#                          This ensures that  lessis used instead of  more.

# 
#                          Since Groff is not installed yet,  Configure thinks that we do not want man pages
#                        for Perl. Issuing these parameters overrides this decision. 
# 
#                -Duseshrplib

#                        (5.32) which allows upgrading Perl to newer Patch levels (5.32.1) without the need
#                        to reinstall all of the modules again.

#        8.47. Libffi-3.3  
# 
#                          The Libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to various
#                        calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function specified by
#                        a call interface description at run time.

#          8.47.1. Installation of Libffi 
#          Note 
# 
#                          Similar to GMP, libffi builds with optimizations specific to the proccesor in use.
#                        If building for another system, export CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to specify a generic
#                        build for your architecture. If this is not done, all applications that link to
#                        libffi will trigger Illegal Operation Errors. 
#

# 
#                --with-gcc-arch=native 
# 
#                          Ensure GCC optimizes for the current system. If this is not specified, the system
#                        is guessed and the code generated may not be correct for some systems. If the generated
#                        code will be copied from the native system to a less capable system, use the less
#                        capable system as a parameter. For details about alternative system types, see the

#        8.50. Ninja-1.10.2  
# 
#                          Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. 
#           Approximate build time: 0.2 SBU
#           Required disk space: 79 MB
#          Tip 
# 
#                          This section is not strictly required for LFS if not using systemd. On the other
#                        hand, ninja associated to meson makes a powerful build system combination, which
#                        is expected to be used more and more often. It is required for several packages
#                        in the BLFS book.  
#          8.50.1. Installation of Ninja 
# 
#                          When run, ninja normally runs a maximum number of processes in parallel. By default
#                        this is the number of cores on the system plus two. In some cases this can overheat
#                        a CPU or run a system out of memory. If run from the command line, passing a -jN
#                        parameter will limit the number of parallel processes, but some packages embed the
#                        execution of ninja and do not pass a -j parameter. 
# 
#                          Using the  optional procedure below allows a user to limit the number of parallel
#                        processes via an environment variable, NINJAJOBS.  For example , setting: 



export NINJAJOBS=4



# 
#                          will limit ninja to four parallel processes. 
# 
#                          If desired, add the capability to use the environment variable NINJAJOBS by running:
#                        



sed -i '/int Guess/a \
  int   j = 0;\
  char* jobs = getenv( "NINJAJOBS" );\
  if ( jobs != NULL ) j = atoi( jobs );\
  if ( j > 0 ) return j;\
' src/ninja.cc



# 
#                          Build Ninja with: 



python3 configure.py --bootstrap


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the build option: 
# 
#                --bootstrap 
# 
#                          This parameter forces ninja to rebuild itself for the current system. 
# 
#                          To test the results, issue:

#        8.51. Meson-0.57.1  
# 
#                          Meson is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast and as user
#                        friendly as possible. 
#           Approximate build time: less than 0.1 SBU
#           Required disk space: 37 MB
#          Tip 
# 
#                          This section is not strictly required for LFS if not using systemd. On the other
#                        hand, meson/ninja is a powerful build system, which is expected to be used more
#                        and more often. It is required for several packages in the BLFS book.  
#          8.51.1. Installation of Meson 
# 
#                          Compile Meson with the following command: 



python3 setup.py build



# 
#                          This package does not come with a test suite. 
# 
#                          Install the package: 



python3 setup.py install --root=dest
cp -rv dest/* /


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the install parameters: 
# 
#                --root=dest 
# 
#                          By default  python3 setup.py install installs various files (such as man pages) into
#                        Python Eggs. With a specified root location,  setup.py installs these files into a
#                        standard hierarchy. Then the hierarchy can just be copied to the standard location.

#        8.52. Coreutils-8.32  
# 
#                          The Coreutils package contains utilities for showing and setting the basic system
#                        characteristics. 
#           Approximate build time: 2.5 SBU
#           Required disk space: 164 MB
#          8.52.1. Installation of Coreutils 
# 
#                          POSIX requires that programs from Coreutils recognize character boundaries correctly
#                        even in multibyte locales. The following patch fixes this non-compliance and other
#                        internationalization-related bugs. 



patch -Np1 -i ../coreutils-8.32-i18n-1.patch



#          Note 
# 
#                          In the past, many bugs were found in this patch. When reporting new bugs to Coreutils
#                        maintainers, please check first if they are reproducible without this patch. 
# 
#                          Suppress a test which on some machines can loop forever: 



sed -i '/test.lock/s/^/#/' gnulib-tests/gnulib.mk



# 
#                          Now prepare Coreutils for compilation: 



autoreconf -fiv
FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1 ./configure \
            --prefix=/usr            \
            --enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the configure options: 
# 
#                
#           autoreconf 
# 
#                          The patch for internationalization has modified the building system of the package,
#                        so the configuration files have to be regenerated. 
# 
#                FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1
# 
#                          This environment variable allows the package to be built as the rootuser. 
# 
#                --enable-no-install-program=kill,uptime 
# 
#                          The purpose of this switch is to prevent Coreutils from installing binaries that
#                        will be installed by other packages later. 
# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          Skip down to "Install the package"if not running the test suite. 
# 
#                          Now the test suite is ready to be run. First, run the tests that are meant to be
#                        run as user root: 



make NON_ROOT_USERNAME=tester check-root



# 
#                          We're going to run the remainder of the tests as the testeruser. Certain tests require
#                        that the user be a member of more than one group. So that these tests are not skipped,
#                        add a temporary group and make the user testera part of it: 



echo "dummy:x:102:tester" >> /etc/group



# 
#                          Fix some of the permissions so that the non-root user can compile and run the tests:
#                        



chown -Rv tester . 



# 
#                          Now run the tests: 



su tester -c "PATH=$PATH make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check"



# 
#                          The test-getlogin test is known to fail in the LFS chroot environment. 
# 
#                          Remove the temporary group: 



sed -i '/dummy/d' /etc/group



# 
#                          Install the package: 



make install



# 
#                          Move programs to the locations specified by the FHS: 



mv -v /usr/bin/{cat,chgrp,chmod,chown,cp,date,dd,df,echo} /bin
mv -v /usr/bin/{false,ln,ls,mkdir,mknod,mv,pwd,rm} /bin
mv -v /usr/bin/{rmdir,stty,sync,true,uname} /bin
mv -v /usr/bin/chroot /usr/sbin
mv -v /usr/share/man/man1/chroot.1 /usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8
sed -i 's/"1"/"8"/' /usr/share/man/man8/chroot.8



# 
#                          Some of the scripts in the LFS-Bootscripts package depend on  head ,  nice ,  sleep ,
#                        and  touch . As /usrmay not be available during the early and late stages of booting,
#                        those binaries need to be on the root partition to maintain FHS compliance: 



mv -v /usr/bin/{head,nice,sleep,touch} /bin

#        8.57. Groff-1.22.4  
# 
#                          The Groff package contains programs for processing and formatting text. 
#           Approximate build time: 0.5 SBU
#           Required disk space: 96 MB
#          8.57.1. Installation of Groff 
# 
#                          Groff expects the environment variable PAGEto contain the default paper size. For
#                        users in the United States,  PAGE=letteris appropriate. Elsewhere,  PAGE=A4may be
#                        more suitable. While the default paper size is configured during compilation, it
#                        can be overridden later by echoing either "A4"or "letter"to the /etc/papersizefile.
#                         
# 
#                          Prepare Groff for compilation: 



PAGE=<paper_size> ./configure --prefix=/usr


 
# 
#                          This package does not support parallel build. Compile the package: 



make -j1



# 
#                          This package does not come with a test suite. 
# 
#                          Install the package:

#        8.58. GRUB-2.04  
# 
#                          The GRUB package contains the GRand Unified Bootloader. 
#           Approximate build time: 0.7 SBU
#           Required disk space: 154 MB
#          8.58.1. Installation of GRUB 
# 
#                          First, fix an issue introduced by binutils-2.36: 



sed "s/gold-version/& -R .note.gnu.property/" \
    -i Makefile.in grub-core/Makefile.in



# 
#                          Prepare GRUB for compilation: 



./configure --prefix=/usr          \

            --disable-werror


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the new configure options: 
# 
#                --disable-werror 
# 
#                          This allows the build to complete with warnings introduced by more recent Flex versions.
#                        
# 
#                --disable-efiemu 
# 
#                          This option minimizes what is built by disabling a feature and testing programs
#                        not needed for LFS. 
# 
#                          Compile the package:

# 
#                          The behaviour of the backspace and delete keys is not consistent across the keymaps
#                        in the Kbd package. The following patch fixes this issue for i386 keymaps: 



patch -Np1 -i ../kbd-2.4.0-backspace-1.patch



# 
#                          After patching, the backspace key generates the character with code 127, and the
#                        delete key generates a well-known escape sequence. 
# 
#                          Remove the redundant  resizecons program (it requires the defunct svgalib to provide
#                        the video mode files - for normal use  setfont sizes the console appropriately) together

# 
#                          The meaning of the configure option: 
# 
#                --disable-vlock 
# 
#                          This option prevents the vlock utility from being built because it requires the
#                        PAM library, which isn't available in the chroot environment. 
# 
#                          Compile the package:

#          Note 
# 
#                          For some languages (e.g., Belarusian) the Kbd package doesn't provide a useful keymap
#                        where the stock "by"keymap assumes the ISO-8859-5 encoding, and the CP1251 keymap
#                        is normally used. Users of such languages have to download working keymaps separately.

#        8.67. Tar-1.34  
# 
#                          The Tar package provides the ability to create tar archives as well as perform various
#                        other kinds of archive manipulation. Tar can be used on previously created archives
#                        to extract files, to store additional files, or to update or list files which were
#                        already stored. 
#           Approximate build time: 2.0 SBU
#           Required disk space: 41 MB
#          8.67.1. Installation of Tar 
# 
#                          Prepare Tar for compilation:

./configure --prefix=/usr \
            --bindir=/bin


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the configure option: 
# 
#                FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1
# 
#                          This forces the test for mknodto be run as root. It is generally considered dangerous
#                        to run this test as the rootuser, but as it is being run on a system that has only
#                        been partially built, overriding it is OK. 
# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          To test the results (about 3 SBU), issue: 



make check



# 
#                          One test, capabilities: binary store/restore, is known to fail.

#                          The Info documentation system uses a plain text file to hold its list of menu entries.
#                        The file is located at /usr/share/info/dir. Unfortunately, due to occasional problems
#                        in the Makefiles of various packages, it can sometimes get out of sync with the
#                        info pages installed on the system. If the /usr/share/info/dirfile ever needs to
#                        be recreated, the following optional commands will accomplish the task: 



pushd /usr/share/info

#        8.69. Vim-8.2.2433  
# 
#                          The Vim package contains a powerful text editor. 
#           Approximate build time: 2.0 SBU
#           Required disk space: 208 MB
#          Alternatives to Vim 
# 
#                          If you prefer another editor;such as Emacs, Joe, or Nano;please refer to http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/10.1/postlfs/editors.htmlfor
#                        suggested installation instructions.  
#          8.69.1. Installation of Vim 
# 
#                          First, change the default location of the vimrcconfiguration file to /etc: 



echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE "/etc/vimrc"' >> src/feature.h



# 
#                          Prepare vim for compilation: 



./configure --prefix=/usr



# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          To prepare the tests, ensure that user testercan write to the source tree: 



chown -Rv tester .



# 
#                          Now run the tests as user tester: 



su tester -c "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 make -j1 test" &> vim-test.log



# 
#                          The test suite outputs a lot of binary data to the screen. This can cause issues
#                        with the settings of the current terminal. The problem can be avoided by redirecting
#                        the output to a log file as shown above. A successful test will result in the words
#                        "ALL DONE" in the log file at completion. 
# 
#                          Install the package: 



make install



# 
#                          Many users are used to using  vi instead of  vim . To allow execution of  vim when users
#                        habitually enter  vi , create a symlink for both the binary and the man page in the
#                        provided languages: 



ln -sv vim /usr/bin/vi
for L in  /usr/share/man/{,*/}man1/vim.1; do
    ln -sv vim.1 $(dirname $L)/vi.1
done



# 
#                          By default, vim's documentation is installed in /usr/share/vim. The following symlink
#                        allows the documentation to be accessed via /usr/share/doc/vim-8.2.2433, making
#                        it consistent with the location of documentation for other packages: 



ln -sv ../vim/vim82/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-8.2.2433



# 
#                          If an X Window System is going to be installed on the LFS system, it may be necessary
#                        to recompile vim after installing X. Vim comes with a GUI version of the editor
#                        that requires X and some additional libraries to be installed. For more information
#                        on this process, refer to the vim documentation and the vim installation page in
#                        the BLFS book at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/10.1/postlfs/vim.html.
#                          
#          8.69.2. Configuring Vim  
# 
#                          By default, vim runs in vi-incompatible mode. This may be new to users who have used
#                        other editors in the past. The "nocompatible"setting is included below to highlight
#                        the fact that a new behavior is being used. It also reminds those who would change
#                        to "compatible"mode that it should be the first setting in the configuration file.
#                        This is necessary because it changes other settings, and overrides must come after
#                        this setting. Create a default  vim configuration file by running the following: 



cat > /etc/vimrc << "EOF"
" Begin /etc/vimrc

" Ensure defaults are set before customizing settings, not after
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim
let skip_defaults_vim=1 

set nocompatible
set backspace=2
set mouse=
syntax on
if (&term == "xterm") || (&term == "putty")
  set background=dark
endif

" End /etc/vimrc
EOF



# 
#                          The  set nocompatiblesetting makes  vim behave in a more useful way (the default) than
#                        the vi-compatible manner. Remove the "no"to keep the old  vi behavior. The  set backspace=2setting
#                        allows backspacing over line breaks, autoindents, and the start of an insert. The
#                         syntax onparameter enables vim's syntax highlighting. The  set mouse=setting enables
#                        proper pasting of text with the mouse when working in chroot or over a remote connection.
#                        Finally, the  if statement with the  set background=darksetting corrects  vim 's guess
#                        about the background color of some terminal emulators. This gives the highlighting
#                        a better color scheme for use on the black background of these programs. 
# 
#                          Documentation for other available options can be obtained by running the following
#                        command: 



vim -c ':options'



#          Note 
# 
#                          By default, vim only installs spell files for the English language. To install spell
#                        files for your preferred language, download the *.spland optionally, the *.sugfiles
#                        for your language and character encoding from ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/and
#                        save them to /usr/share/vim/vim82/spell/.  
# 
#                          To use these spell files, some configuration in /etc/vimrcis needed, e.g.: 



set spelllang=en,ru
set spell

#        8.71. Procps-ng-3.3.17  
# 
#                          The Procps-ng package contains programs for monitoring processes. 
#          Note 
# 
#                          This package extracts to the directory procps-3.3.17, not the expected procps-ng-3.3.17.
#                        
#           Approximate build time: 0.5 SBU
#           Required disk space: 20 MB
#          8.71.1. Installation of Procps-ng 
# 
#                          Prepare procps-ng for compilation: 



./configure --prefix=/usr                            \
            --exec-prefix=                           \
            --libdir=/usr/lib                        \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/procps-ng-3.3.17 \
            --disable-static                         \
            --disable-kill


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the configure option: 
# 
#                --disable-kill 
# 
#                          This switch disables building the  kill command that will be installed by the Util-linux
#                        package. 
# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          To run the test suite, run: 



make check



# 
#                          Five tests related to pkill are known to fail due to a problem with tests that were
#                        not updated. 
# 
#                          Install the package: 



make install



# 
#                          Finally, move essential libraries to a location that can be found if /usris not
#                        mounted.

#          8.72.1. Installation of Util-linux 
# 
#                          Prepare Util-linux for compilation:

#                          The --disable and --without options prevent warnings about building components that

#                        packages.

make



# 
#                          If desired, run the test suite as a non-root user: 
#          Warning 
# 
#                          Running the test suite as the rootuser can be harmful to your system. To run it,
#                        the CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG option for the kernel must be available in the currently running
#                        system and must be built as a module. Building it into the kernel will prevent booting.
#                        For complete coverage, other BLFS packages must be installed. If desired, this test
#                        can be run after rebooting into the completed LFS system and running:

#        8.73. E2fsprogs-1.46.1  
# 
#                          The e2fsprogs package contains the utilities for handling the ext2file system. It
#                        also supports the ext3and ext4journaling file systems. 
#           Approximate build time: 4.4 SBU on a spinning disk, 1.5 SBU on an SSD
#           Required disk space: 102 MB
#          8.73.1. Installation of E2fsprogs 
# 
#                          The e2fsprogs documentation recommends that the package be built in a subdirectory
#                        of the source tree: 



mkdir -v build
cd       build



# 
#                          Prepare e2fsprogs for compilation: 



../configure --prefix=/usr           \
             --bindir=/bin           \
             --with-root-prefix=""   \
             --enable-elf-shlibs     \
             --disable-libblkid      \
             --disable-libuuid       \
             --disable-uuidd         \
             --disable-fsck


 
# 
#                          The meaning of the configure options: 
# 
#                --with-root-prefix=""and  --bindir=/bin 
# 
#                          Certain programs (such as the  e2fsck program) are considered essential programs.
#                        When, for example, /usris not mounted, these programs still need to be available.
#                        They belong in directories like /liband /sbin. If this option is not passed to configure,
#                        the programs are installed into the /usrdirectory. 
# 
#                --enable-elf-shlibs 
# 
#                          This creates the shared libraries which some programs in this package use. 
# 
#                --disable-* 
# 
#                          This prevents e2fsprogs from building and installing the libuuidand libblkidlibraries,
#                        the uuidddaemon, and the  fsck wrapper, as util-linux installs more recent versions.
#                        
# 
#                          Compile the package: 



make



# 
#                          To run the tests, issue: 



make check



# 
#                          One test, m_rootdir_acl, is known to fail. 
# 
#                          On a spinning disk, the tests take a little more than 4 SBUs. They can be much shorter
#                        on an SSD (down to about 1.5 SBUs). 
# 
#                          Install the package: 



make install



# 
#                          Remove useless static libraries: 



rm -fv /usr/lib/{libcom_err,libe2p,libext2fs,libss}.a



# 
#                          This package installs a gzipped .infofile but doesn't update the system-wide dirfile.
#                        Unzip this file and then update the system dirfile using the following commands:
#                        



gunzip -v /usr/share/info/libext2fs.info.gz
install-info --dir-file=/usr/share/info/dir /usr/share/info/libext2fs.info



# 
#                          If desired, create and install some additional documentation by issuing the following
#                        commands: 



makeinfo -o      doc/com_err.info ../lib/et/com_err.texinfo
install -v -m644 doc/com_err.info /usr/share/info
install-info --dir-file=/usr/share/info/dir /usr/share/info/com_err.info

#        8.76. About Debugging Symbols  
# 
#                          Most programs and libraries are, by default, compiled with debugging symbols included
#                        (with gcc 's  -goption). This means that when debugging a program or library that
#                        was compiled with debugging information, the debugger can provide not only memory
#                        addresses, but also the names of the routines and variables.  
# 
#                          However, the inclusion of these debugging symbols enlarges a program or library
#                        significantly. The following is an example of the amount of space these symbols
#                        occupy: 
# 
#                          A bash binary with debugging symbols: 1200 KB 
# 
#                          A  bash binary without debugging symbols: 480 KB 
# 
#                          Glibc and GCC files (/liband /usr/lib) with debugging symbols: 87 MB 
# 
#                          Glibc and GCC files without debugging symbols: 16 MB 
# 
#                          Sizes may vary depending on which compiler and C library were used, but when comparing
#                        programs with and without debugging symbols, the difference will usually be a factor
#                        between two and five. 
# 
#                          Because most users will never use a debugger on their system software, a lot of
#                        disk space can be regained by removing these symbols. The next section shows how
#                        to strip all debugging symbols from the programs and libraries.  
#        8.77. Stripping Again  
# 
#                          This section is optional. If the intended user is not a programmer and does not
#                        plan to do any debugging on the system software, the system size can be decreased
#                        by about 2 GB by removing the debugging symbols from binaries and libraries. This
#                        causes no inconvenience other than not being able to debug the software fully anymore.
#                        
# 
#                          Most people who use the commands mentioned below do not experience any difficulties.
#                        However, it is easy to make a typo and render the new system unusable, so before
#                        running the strip commands, it is a good idea to make a backup of the LFS system
#                        in its current state. 
# 
#                          First place the debugging symbols for selected libraries in separate files. This
#                        debugging information is needed if running regression tests that use valgrindor
#                        gdblater in BLFS.

# cd /lib
# 
# for LIB in $save_lib; do
#     objcopy --only-keep-debug $LIB $LIB.dbg 
#     strip --strip-unneeded $LIB
#     objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=$LIB.dbg $LIB 
# done

#     objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=$LIB.dbg $LIB
# done
# 
# unset LIB save_lib save_usrlib
# 


# 
#                          Now the binaries and libraries can be stripped: 



# find /usr/lib -type f -name \*.a \
#    -exec strip --strip-debug {} ';'
# 
# find /lib /usr/lib -type f -name \*.so* ! -name \*dbg \
#    -exec strip --strip-unneeded {} ';'
# 
# find /{bin,sbin} /usr/{bin,sbin,libexec} -type f \
#     -exec strip --strip-all {} ';'
# 


# 
#                          A large number of files will be reported as having their file format not recognized.
#                        These warnings can be safely ignored. These warnings indicate that those files are
#                        scripts instead of binaries.

#                          Here the +hoption is not used anymore, since all the previous programs have been

#                          If the virtual kernel file systems have been unmounted, either manually or through
#                        a reboot, ensure that the virtual kernel file systems are mounted when reentering
#                        the chroot. This process was explained in Section 7.3.2, "Mounting and Populating
#                        /dev"and Section 7.3.3, "Mounting Virtual Kernel File Systems".

#                          There are also several files installed in the /usr/lib and /usr/libexec directories
#                        with a file name extension of .la. These are "libtool archive" files. As already
#                        said, they are only useful when linking with static libraries. They are unneeded,
#                        and potentially harmful, when using dynamic shared libraries, specially when using
#                        also non-autotools build systems. To remove them, run: 



find /usr/lib /usr/libexec -name \*.la -delete



# 
#                          For more information about libtool archive files, see the BLFS section "About Libtool
#                        Archive (.la) files".

#                          The compiler built in Chapter 6and Chapter 7is still partially installed and not
#                        needed anymore. Remove it with:  



find /usr -depth -name $(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu\* | xargs rm -rf



# 
#                          The /toolsdirectory can also be removed to further gain some space: 



rm -rf /tools



# 
#                          Finally, remove the temporary 'tester' user account created at the beginning of
#                        the previous chapter.

#        Chapter 9. System Configuration  
#        9.1. Introduction  
# 
#                          Booting a Linux system involves several tasks. The process must mount both virtual
#                        and real file systems, initialize devices, activate swap, check file systems for
#                        integrity, mount any swap partitions or files, set the system clock, bring up networking,
#                        start any daemons required by the system, and accomplish any other custom tasks
#                        needed by the user. This process must be organized to ensure the tasks are performed
#                        in the correct order but, at the same time, be executed as fast as possible. 
#          9.1.1. System V  
# 
#                          System V is the classic boot process that has been used in Unix and Unix-like systems
#                        such as Linux since about 1983. It consists of a small program, init , that sets
#                        up basic programs such as  login (via getty) and runs a script. This script, usually
#                        named  rc , controls the execution of a set of additional scripts that perform the
#                        tasks required to initialize the system. 
# 
#                          The  init program is controlled by the /etc/inittabfile and is organized into run
#                        levels that can be run by the user: 
# 
#                          0 ; halt1 ; Single user mode2 ; Multiuser, without networking3 ; Full multiuser
#                        mode4 ; User definable5 ; Full multiuser mode with display manager6 ; reboot 
# 
#                          The usual default run level is 3 or 5.  
#            Advantages  
# 
#                          Established, well understood system. 
# 
#                          Easy to customize. 
#            Disadvantages  
# 
#                          May be slower to boot. A medium speed base LFS system takes 8-12 seconds where the
#                        boot time is measured from the first kernel message to the login prompt. Network
#                        connectivity is typically established about 2 seconds after the login prompt. 
# 
#                          Serial processing of boot tasks. This is related to the previous point. A delay
#                        in any process such as a file system check, will delay the entire boot process.
#                        
# 
#                          Does not directly support advanced features like control groups (cgroups), and per-user
#                        fair share scheduling. 
# 
#                          Adding scripts requires manual, static sequencing decisions. 
#        9.2. LFS-Bootscripts-20210201  
# 
#                          The LFS-Bootscripts package contains a set of scripts to start/stop the LFS system
#                        at bootup/shutdown. The configuration files and procedures needed to customize the
#                        boot process are described in the following sections. 
#           Approximate build time: less than 0.1 SBU

#        9.3. Overview of Device and Module Handling  
# 
#                          In Chapter 8, we installed the udev package when eudevwas built. Before we go into
#                        the details regarding how this works, a brief history of previous methods of handling
#                        devices is in order.  
# 
#                          Linux systems in general traditionally used a static device creation method, whereby
#                        a great many device nodes were created under /dev(sometimes literally thousands
#                        of nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices actually existed.
#                        This was typically done via a  MAKEDEV script, which contains a number of calls to
#                        the  mknod program with the relevant major and minor device numbers for every possible
#                        device that might exist in the world. 
# 
#                          Using the udev method, only those devices which are detected by the kernel get device
#                        nodes created for them. Because these device nodes will be created each time the
#                        system boots, they will be stored on a devtmpfsfile system (a virtual file system
#                        that resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not require much space,
#                        so the memory that is used is negligible. 
#          9.3.1. History 
# 
#                          In February 2000, a new filesystem called devfswas merged into the 2.3.46 kernel
#                        and was made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although it was
#                        present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating devices dynamically
#                        never received overwhelming support from the core kernel developers. 
# 
#                          The main problem with the approach adopted by devfswas the way it handled device
#                        detection, creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node naming, was
#                        perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if device names are allowed
#                        to be configurable, then the device naming policy should be up to a system administrator,
#                        not imposed on them by any particular developer(s). The devfsfile system also suffered
#                        from race conditions that were inherent in its design and could not be fixed without
#                        a substantial revision to the kernel. It was marked as deprecated for a long period
#                        - due to a lack of maintenance - and was finally removed from the kernel in June,
#                        2006. 
# 
#                          With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later released as the 2.6
#                        series of stable kernels, a new virtual filesystem called sysfscame to be. The job
#                        of sysfsis to export a view of the system's hardware configuration to userspace
#                        processes. With this userspace-visible representation, the possibility of developing
#                        a userspace replacement for devfsbecame much more realistic. 
#          9.3.2. Udev Implementation  
#            9.3.2.1. Sysfs  
# 
#                          The sysfsfilesystem was mentioned briefly above. One may wonder how sysfsknows about
#                        the devices present on a system and what device numbers should be used for them.
#                        Drivers that have been compiled into the kernel directly register their objects
#                        with a sysfs(devtmpfs internally) as they are detected by the kernel. For drivers
#                        compiled as modules, this registration will happen when the module is loaded. Once
#                        the sysfsfilesystem is mounted (on /sys), data which the drivers register with sysfsare
#                        available to userspace processes and to udevd for processing (including modifications
#                        to device nodes). 
#            9.3.2.2. Device Node Creation  
# 
#                          Device files are created by the kernel by the devtmpfsfilesystem. Any driver that
#                        wishes to register a device node will go through the devtmpfs(via the driver core)
#                        to do it. When a devtmpfsinstance is mounted on /dev, the device node will initially
#                        be created with a fixed name, permissions, and owner. 
# 
#                          A short time later, the kernel will send a uevent to udevd . Based on the rules specified
#                        in the files within the /etc/udev/rules.d, /lib/udev/rules.d, and /run/udev/rules.ddirectories,
#                         udevd will create additional symlinks to the device node, or change its permissions,
#                        owner, or group, or modify the internal  udevd database entry (name) for that object.
#                        
# 
#                          The rules in these three directories are numbered and all three directories are
#                        merged together. If  udevd can't find a rule for the device it is creating, it will
#                        leave the permissions and ownership at whatever devtmpfsused initially.  
#            9.3.2.3. Module Loading  
# 
#                          Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into them. Aliases are
#                        visible in the output of the modinfo program and are usually related to the bus-specific
#                        identifiers of devices supported by a module. For example, the  snd-fm801 driver supports
#                        PCI devices with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of "pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*".
#                        For most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver that would handle
#                        the device via sysfs. E.g., the /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modaliasfile might
#                        contain the string "pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00". The
#                        default rules provided with udev will cause  udevd to call out to  /sbin/modprobe with
#                        the contents of the MODALIASuevent environment variable (which should be the same
#                        as the contents of the modaliasfile in sysfs), thus loading all modules whose aliases
#                        match this string after wildcard expansion. 
# 
#                          In this example, this means that, in addition to  snd-fm801 , the obsolete (and unwanted)
#                         forte driver will be loaded if it is available. See below for ways in which the loading
#                        of unwanted drivers can be prevented. 
# 
#                          The kernel itself is also able to load modules for network protocols, filesystems,
#                        and NLS support on demand.  
#            9.3.2.4. Handling Hotpluggable/Dynamic Devices  
# 
#                          When you plug in a device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) MP3 player, the
#                        kernel recognizes that the device is now connected and generates a uevent. This
#                        uevent is then handled by udevd as described above. 
#          9.3.3. Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices 
# 
#                          There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically creating device
#                        nodes.  
#            9.3.3.1. A kernel module is not loaded automatically  
# 
#                          Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and the bus driver properly
#                        exports the necessary aliases to sysfs. In other cases, one should arrange module
#                        loading by other means. With Linux-5.10.17, udev is known to load properly-written
#                        drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB, SCSI, SERIO, and FireWire devices. 
# 
#                          To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary support for udev,
#                        run modinfo with the module name as the argument. Now try locating the device directory
#                        under /sys/busand check whether there is a modaliasfile there. 
# 
#                          If the modaliasfile exists in sysfs, the driver supports the device and can talk
#                        to it directly, but doesn't have the alias, it is a bug in the driver. Load the
#                        driver without the help from udev and expect the issue to be fixed later. 
# 
#                          If there is no modaliasfile in the relevant directory under /sys/bus, this means
#                        that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias support to this bus type.
#                        With Linux-5.10.17, this is the case with ISA busses. Expect this issue to be fixed
#                        in later kernel versions. 
# 
#                          Udev is not intended to load "wrapper"drivers such as  snd-pcm-oss and non-hardware
#                        drivers such as  loop at all.  
#            9.3.3.2. A kernel module is not loaded automatically, and udev is not intended to load it  
# 
#                          If the "wrapper"module only enhances the functionality provided by some other module
#                        (e.g.,  snd-pcm-oss enhances the functionality of  snd-pcm by making the sound cards
#                        available to OSS applications), configure  modprobe to load the wrapper after udev
#                        loads the wrapped module. To do this, add a "softdep"line to the corresponding /etc/modprobe.d/ <filename>.conffile.
#                        For example:  



# softdep snd-pcm post: snd-pcm-oss
# 


# 
#                          Note that the "softdep"command also allows pre:dependencies, or a mixture of both
#                        pre:and post:dependencies. See the modprobe.d(5)manual page for more information
#                        on "softdep"syntax and capabilities. 
# 
#                          If the module in question is not a wrapper and is useful by itself, configure the
#                         modules bootscript to load this module on system boot. To do this, add the module
#                        name to the /etc/sysconfig/modulesfile on a separate line. This works for wrapper
#                        modules too, but is suboptimal in that case.  
#            9.3.3.3. Udev loads some unwanted module  
# 
#                          Either don't build the module, or blacklist it in a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conffile
#                        as done with the forte module in the example below: 



# blacklist forte
# 


# 
#                          Blacklisted modules can still be loaded manually with the explicit  modprobe command.
#                         
#            9.3.3.4. Udev creates a device incorrectly, or makes a wrong symlink  
# 
#                          This usually happens if a rule unexpectedly matches a device. For example, a poorly-written
#                        rule can match both a SCSI disk (as desired) and the corresponding SCSI generic
#                        device (incorrectly) by vendor. Find the offending rule and make it more specific,
#                        with the help of the udevadm info command.  
#            9.3.3.5. Udev rule works unreliably  
# 
#                          This may be another manifestation of the previous problem. If not, and your rule
#                        uses sysfsattributes, it may be a kernel timing issue, to be fixed in later kernels.
#                        For now, you can work around it by creating a rule that waits for the used sysfsattribute
#                        and appending it to the /etc/udev/rules.d/10-wait_for_sysfs.rulesfile (create this
#                        file if it does not exist). Please notify the LFS Development list if you do so
#                        and it helps. 
#            9.3.3.6. Udev does not create a device  
# 
#                          Further text assumes that the driver is built statically into the kernel or already
#                        loaded as a module, and that you have already checked that udev doesn't create a
#                        misnamed device. 
# 
#                          Udev has no information needed to create a device node if a kernel driver does not
#                        export its data to sysfs. This is most common with third party drivers from outside
#                        the kernel tree. Create a static device node in /lib/udev/deviceswith the appropriate
#                        major/minor numbers (see the file devices.txtinside the kernel documentation or
#                        the documentation provided by the third party driver vendor). The static device
#                        node will be copied to /devby udev .  
#            9.3.3.7. Device naming order changes randomly after rebooting  
# 
#                          This is due to the fact that udev, by design, handles uevents and loads modules
#                        in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order. This will never be "fixed". You
#                        should not rely upon the kernel device names being stable. Instead, create your
#                        own rules that make symlinks with stable names based on some stable attributes of
#                        the device, such as a serial number or the output of various *_id utilities installed
#                        by udev. See Section 9.4, "Managing Devices"and Section 9.5, "General Network Configuration"for
#                        examples.  
#          9.3.4. Useful Reading

#        9.4. Managing Devices  
#          9.4.1. Network Devices 
# 
#                          Udev, by default, names network devices according to Firmware/BIOS data or physical
#                        characteristics like the bus, slot, or MAC address. The purpose of this naming convention
#                        is to ensure that network devices are named consistently and not based on the time
#                        the network card was discovered. For example, on a computer having two network cards
#                        made by Intel and Realtek, the network card manufactured by Intel may become eth0
#                        and the Realtek card becomes eth1. In some cases, after a reboot the cards could
#                        get renumbered the other way around. 
# 
#                          In the new naming scheme, typical network device names would then be something like
#                        enp5s0 or wlp3s0. If this naming convention is not desired, the traditional naming
#                        scheme or a custom scheme can be implemented. 
#            9.4.1.1. Disabling Persistent Naming on the Kernel Command Line  
# 
#                          The traditional naming scheme using eth0, eth1, etc can be restored by adding net.ifnames=0on
#                        the kernel command line. This is most appropriate for those systems that have only
#                        one ethernet device of the same type. Laptops often have multiple ethernet connections
#                        that are named eth0 and wlan0 and are also candidates for this method. The command
#                        line is passed in the GRUB configuration file. See Section 10.4.4, "Creating the
#                        GRUB Configuration File".   
#            9.4.1.2. Creating Custom Udev Rules  
# 
#                          The naming scheme can be customized by creating custom udev rules. A script has
#                        been included that generates the initial rules. Generate these rules by running:
#                        



# bash /lib/udev/init-net-rules.sh
# 


# 
#                          Now, inspect the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rulesfile, to find out which
#                        name was assigned to which network device: 



# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
# 


#          Note 
# 
#                          In some cases such as when MAC addresses have been assigned to a network card manually
#                        or in a virtual environment such as Qemu or Xen, the network rules file may not
#                        have been generated because addresses are not consistently assigned. In these cases,
#                        this method cannot be used. 
# 
#                          The file begins with a comment block followed by two lines for each NIC. The first
#                        line for each NIC is a commented description showing its hardware IDs (e.g. its
#                        PCI vendor and device IDs, if it's a PCI card), along with its driver in parentheses,
#                        if the driver can be found. Neither the hardware ID nor the driver is used to determine
#                        which name to give an interface; this information is only for reference. The second
#                        line is the udev rule that matches this NIC and actually assigns it a name. 
# 
#                          All udev rules are made up of several keys, separated by commas and optional whitespace.
#                        This rule's keys and an explanation of each of them are as follows: 
# 
#                          SUBSYSTEM=="net"- This tells udev to ignore devices that are not network cards.
#                        
# 
#                          ACTION=="add"- This tells udev to ignore this rule for a uevent that isn't an add
#                        ("remove" and "change" uevents also happen, but don't need to rename network interfaces).
#                        
# 
#                          DRIVERS=="?*"- This exists so that udev will ignore VLAN or bridge sub-interfaces
#                        (because these sub-interfaces do not have drivers). These sub-interfaces are skipped
#                        because the name that would be assigned would collide with their parent devices.
#                        
# 
#                          ATTR{address}- The value of this key is the NIC's MAC address. 
# 
#                          ATTR{type}=="1"- This ensures the rule only matches the primary interface in the
#                        case of certain wireless drivers which create multiple virtual interfaces. The secondary
#                        interfaces are skipped for the same reason that VLAN and bridge sub-interfaces are
#                        skipped: there would be a name collision otherwise. 
# 
#                          NAME- The value of this key is the name that udev will assign to this interface.
#                        
# 
#                          The value of NAMEis the important part. Make sure you know which name has been assigned
#                        to each of your network cards before proceeding, and be sure to use that NAMEvalue
#                        when creating your configuration files below. 
#          9.4.2. CD-ROM symlinks 
# 
#                          Some software that you may want to install later (e.g., various media players) expect
#                        the /dev/cdromand /dev/dvdsymlinks to exist, and to point to a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
#                        device. Also, it may be convenient to put references to those symlinks into /etc/fstab.
#                        Udev comes with a script that will generate rules files to create these symlinks
#                        for you, depending on the capabilities of each device, but you need to decide which
#                        of two modes of operation you wish to have the script use. 
# 
#                          First, the script can operate in "by-path"mode (used by default for USB and FireWire
#                        devices), where the rules it creates depend on the physical path to the CD or DVD
#                        device. Second, it can operate in "by-id"mode (default for IDE and SCSI devices),
#                        where the rules it creates depend on identification strings stored on the CD or
#                        DVD device itself. The path is determined by udev's  path_id script, and the identification
#                        strings are read from the hardware by its  ata_id or  scsi_id programs, depending on
#                        which type of device you have. 
# 
#                          There are advantages to each approach; the correct approach to use will depend on
#                        what kinds of device changes may happen. If you expect the physical path to the
#                        device (that is, the ports and/or slots that it plugs into) to change, for example
#                        because you plan on moving the drive to a different IDE port or a different USB
#                        connector, then you should use the "by-id"mode. On the other hand, if you expect
#                        the device's identification to change, for example because it may die, and you would
#                        replace it with a different device with the same capabilities and which is plugged
#                        into the same connectors, then you should use the "by-path"mode. 
# 
#                          If either type of change is possible with your drive, then choose a mode based on
#                        the type of change you expect to happen more often. 
#          Important 
# 
#                          External devices (for example, a USB-connected CD drive) should not use by-path
#                        persistence, because each time the device is plugged into a new external port, its
#                        physical path will change. All externally-connected devices will have this problem
#                        if you write udev rules to recognize them by their physical path; the problem is
#                        not limited to CD and DVD drives. 
# 
#                          If you wish to see the values that the udev scripts will use, then for the appropriate
#                        CD-ROM device, find the corresponding directory under /sys(e.g., this can be /sys/block/hdd)
#                        and run a command similar to the following: 



# udevadm test /sys/block/hdd
# 


# 
#                          Look at the lines containing the output of various *_id programs. The "by-id"mode
#                        will use the ID_SERIAL value if it exists and is not empty, otherwise it will use
#                        a combination of ID_MODEL and ID_REVISION. The "by-path"mode will use the ID_PATH
#                        value. 
# 
#                          If the default mode is not suitable for your situation, then the following modification
#                        can be made to the /etc/udev/rules.d/83-cdrom-symlinks.rulesfile, as follows (where
#                         modeis one of "by-id"or "by-path"):  



# sed -e 's/"write_cd_rules"/"write_cd_rules mode"/' \
#     -i /etc/udev/rules.d/83-cdrom-symlinks.rules
# 

 
# 
#                          Note that it is not necessary to create the rules files or symlinks at this time
#                        because you have bind-mounted the host's /devdirectory into the LFS system and we
#                        assume the symlinks exist on the host. The rules and symlinks will be created the
#                        first time you boot your LFS system. 
# 
#                          However, if you have multiple CD-ROM devices, then the symlinks generated at that
#                        time may point to different devices than they point to on your host because devices
#                        are not discovered in a predictable order. The assignments created when you first
#                        boot the LFS system will be stable, so this is only an issue if you need the symlinks
#                        on both systems to point to the same device. If you need that, then inspect (and
#                        possibly edit) the generated /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rulesfile after
#                        booting, to make sure the assigned symlinks match what you need. 
#          9.4.3. Dealing with duplicate devices 
# 
#                          As explained in Section 9.3, "Overview of Device and Module Handling", the order
#                        in which devices with the same function appear in /devis essentially random. E.g.,
#                        if you have a USB web camera and a TV tuner, sometimes /dev/video0refers to the
#                        camera and /dev/video1refers to the tuner, and sometimes after a reboot the order
#                        changes. For all classes of hardware except sound cards and network cards, this
#                        is fixable by creating udev rules for custom persistent symlinks. The case of network
#                        cards is covered separately in Section 9.5, "General Network Configuration", and
#                        sound card configuration can be found in BLFS.  
# 
#                          For each of your devices that is likely to have this problem (even if the problem
#                        doesn't exist in your current Linux distribution), find the corresponding directory
#                        under /sys/classor /sys/block. For video devices, this may be /sys/class/video4linux/video X .
#                        Figure out the attributes that identify the device uniquely (usually, vendor and
#                        product IDs and/or serial numbers work): 



# udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/video4linux/video0
# 


# 
#                          Then write rules that create the symlinks, e.g.: 



# cat > /etc/udev/rules.d/83-duplicate_devs.rules << "EOF"
# 
# # Persistent symlinks for webcam and tuner
# KERNEL=="video*", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1910", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0d81", SYMLINK+="webcam"
# KERNEL=="video*", ATTRS{device}=="0x036f",  ATTRS{vendor}=="0x109e", SYMLINK+="tvtuner"
# 
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          The result is that /dev/video0and /dev/video1devices still refer randomly to the
#                        tuner and the web camera (and thus should never be used directly), but there are
#                        symlinks /dev/tvtunerand /dev/webcamthat always point to the correct device. 
#        9.5. General Network Configuration  
#          9.5.1. Creating Network Interface Configuration Files 
# 
#                          Which interfaces are brought up and down by the network script usually depends on
#                        the files in /etc/sysconfig/. This directory should contain a file for each interface
#                        to be configured, such as ifconfig.xyz, where "xyz"should describe the network card.
#                        The interface name (e.g. eth0) is usually appropriate. Inside this file are attributes
#                        to this interface, such as its IP address(es), subnet masks, and so forth. It is
#                        necessary that the stem of the filename be  ifconfig . 
#          Note 
# 
#                          If the procedure in the previous section was not used, udev will assign network
#                        card interface names based on system physical characteristics such as enp2s1. If
#                        you are not sure what your interface name is, you can always run  ip link or  ls /sys/class/net after
#                        you have booted your system. 
# 
#                          The following command creates a sample file for the  eth0 device with a static IP
#                        address: 



# cd /etc/sysconfig/
# cat > ifconfig.eth0 << "EOF"
# ONBOOT=yes
# IFACE=eth0
# SERVICE=ipv4-static
# IP=192.168.1.2
# GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
# PREFIX=24
# BROADCAST=192.168.1.255
# EOF
# 

 
# 
#                          The values in italics must be changed in every file to match the proper setup. 
# 
#                          If the ONBOOTvariable is set to "yes"the System V network script will bring up the
#                        Network Interface Card (NIC) during the system boot process. If set to anything
#                        but "yes"the NIC will be ignored by the network script and not be automatically
#                        brought up. The interface can be manually started or stopped with the  ifup and  ifdown commands.
#                        
# 
#                          The IFACEvariable defines the interface name, for example, eth0. It is required
#                        for all network device configuration files. The filename extension must match this
#                        value. 
# 
#                          The SERVICEvariable defines the method used for obtaining the IP address. The LFS-Bootscripts
#                        package has a modular IP assignment format, and creating additional files in the
#                        /lib/services/directory allows other IP assignment methods. This is commonly used
#                        for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which is addressed in the BLFS book.
#                        
# 
#                          The GATEWAYvariable should contain the default gateway IP address, if one is present.
#                        If not, then comment out the variable entirely. 
# 
#                          The PREFIXvariable contains the number of bits used in the subnet. Each octet in
#                        an IP address is 8 bits. If the subnet's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then it is using
#                        the first three octets (24 bits) to specify the network number. If the netmask is
#                        255.255.255.240, it would be using the first 28 bits. Prefixes longer than 24 bits
#                        are commonly used by DSL and cable-based Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In this
#                        example (PREFIX=24), the netmask is 255.255.255.0. Adjust the PREFIXvariable according
#                        to your specific subnet. If omitted, the PREFIX defaults to 24. 
# 
#                          For more information see the  ifup man page.  
#          9.5.2. Creating the /etc/resolv.conf File  
# 
#                          The system will need some means of obtaining Domain Name Service (DNS) name resolution
#                        to resolve Internet domain names to IP addresses, and vice versa. This is best achieved
#                        by placing the IP address of the DNS server, available from the ISP or network administrator,
#                        into /etc/resolv.conf. Create the file by running the following: 



# cat > /etc/resolv.conf << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/resolv.conf
# 
# domain <Your Domain Name>
# nameserver <IP address of your primary nameserver>
# nameserver <IP address of your secondary nameserver>
# 
# # End /etc/resolv.conf
# EOF
# 

 
# 
#                          The domainstatement can be omitted or replaced with a searchstatement. See the man
#                        page for resolv.conf for more details. 
# 
#                          Replace <IP address of the nameserver>with the IP address of the DNS most appropriate
#                        for the setup. There will often be more than one entry (requirements demand secondary
#                        servers for fallback capability). If you only need or want one DNS server, remove
#                        the second  nameserver line from the file. The IP address may also be a router on
#                        the local network. 
#          Note 
# 
#                          The Google Public IPv4 DNS addresses are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.  
#          9.5.3. Configuring the system hostname  
# 
#                          During the boot process, the file /etc/hostnameis used for establishing the system's
#                        hostname. 
# 
#                          Create the /etc/hostnamefile and enter a hostname by running: 



# echo "<lfs>" > /etc/hostname
# 

 
# 
#                          <lfs>needs to be replaced with the name given to the computer. Do not enter the
#                        Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) here. That information is put in the /etc/hostsfile.
#                         
#          9.5.4. Customizing the /etc/hosts File  
# 
#                          Decide on the IP address, fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), and possible aliases
#                        for use in the /etc/hostsfile. The syntax is: 



# IP_address myhost.example.org aliases
# 


# 
#                          Unless the computer is to be visible to the Internet (i.e., there is a registered
#                        domain and a valid block of assigned IP addresses;most users do not have this),
#                        make sure that the IP address is in the private network IP address range. Valid
#                        ranges are: 



# Private Network Address Range      Normal Prefix
# 10.0.0.1 - 10.255.255.254           8
# 172.x.0.1 - 172.x.255.254           16
# 192.168.y.1 - 192.168.y.254         24
# 


# 
#                          x can be any number in the range 16-31. y can be any number in the range 0-255.
#                        
# 
#                          A valid private IP address could be 192.168.1.1. A valid FQDN for this IP could
#                        be lfs.example.org. 
# 
#                          Even if not using a network card, a valid FQDN is still required. This is necessary
#                        for certain programs to operate correctly. 
# 
#                          Create the /etc/hostsfile by running: 



# cat > /etc/hosts << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/hosts
# 
# 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
# 127.0.1.1 <FQDN> <HOSTNAME>
# <192.168.1.1> <FQDN> <HOSTNAME> [alias1] [alias2 ...]
# ::1       localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
# ff02::1   ip6-allnodes
# ff02::2   ip6-allrouters
# 
# # End /etc/hosts
# EOF
# 

 
# 
#                          The <192.168.1.1>,  <FQDN>, and  <HOSTNAME>values need to be changed for specific
#                        uses or requirements (if assigned an IP address by a network/system administrator
#                        and the machine will be connected to an existing network). The optional alias name(s)
#                        can be omitted.  
#        9.6. System V Bootscript Usage and Configuration  
#          9.6.1. How Do the System V Bootscripts Work? 
# 
#                          Linux uses a special booting facility named SysVinit that is based on a concept
#                        of run-levels . It can be quite different from one system to another, so it cannot
#                        be assumed that because things worked in one particular Linux distribution, they
#                        should work the same in LFS too. LFS has its own way of doing things, but it respects
#                        generally accepted standards. 
# 
#                          SysVinit (which will be referred to as "init"from now on) works using a run-levels
#                        scheme. There are seven (numbered 0 to 6) run-levels (actually, there are more run-levels,
#                        but they are for special cases and are generally not used. See init(8)for more details),
#                        and each one of those corresponds to the actions the computer is supposed to perform
#                        when it starts up. The default run-level is 3. Here are the descriptions of the
#                        different run-levels as they are implemented: 
# 
#                          0: halt the computer1: single-user mode2: multi-user mode without networking3: multi-user
#                        mode with networking4: reserved for customization, otherwise does the same as 35:
#                        same as 4, it is usually used for GUI login (like X's  xdm  or KDE's  kdm )6: reboot
#                        the computer  
#          9.6.2. Configuring Sysvinit  
# 
#                          During the kernel initialization, the first program that is run is either specified
#                        on the command line or, by default init . This program reads the initialization file
#                        /etc/inittab. Create this file with: 



# cat > /etc/inittab << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/inittab
# 
# id:3:initdefault:
# 
# si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc S
# 
# l0:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 0
# l1:S1:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 1
# l2:2:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 2
# l3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 3
# l4:4:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 4
# l5:5:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 5
# l6:6:wait:/etc/rc.d/init.d/rc 6
# 
# ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
# 
# su:S016:once:/sbin/sulogin
# 
# 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty --noclear tty1 9600
# 2:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty2 9600
# 3:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty3 9600
# 4:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty4 9600
# 5:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty5 9600
# 6:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty tty6 9600
# 
# # End /etc/inittab
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          An explanation of this initialization file is in the man page for  inittab . For LFS,
#                        the key command that is run is  rc . The initialization file above will instruct  rc to
#                        run all the scripts starting with an S in the /etc/rc.d/rcS.ddirectory followed
#                        by all the scripts starting with an S in the /etc/rc.d/rc?.ddirectory where the
#                        question mark is specified by the initdefault value. 
# 
#                          As a convenience, the  rc script reads a library of functions in /lib/lsb/init-functions.
#                        This library also reads an optional configuration file, /etc/sysconfig/rc.site.
#                        Any of the system configuration file parameters described in subsequent sections
#                        can be alternatively placed in this file allowing consolidation of all system parameters
#                        in this one file. 
# 
#                          As a debugging convenience, the functions script also logs all output to /run/var/bootlog.
#                        Since the /rundirectory is a tmpfs, this file is not persistent across boots, however
#                        it is appended to the more permanent file /var/log/boot.logat the end of the boot
#                        process.  
#            9.6.2.1. Changing Run Levels  
# 
#                          Changing run-levels is done with init <runlevel>  , where  <runlevel>is the target
#                        run-level. For example, to reboot the computer, a user could issue the  init 6 command,
#                        which is an alias for the  reboot command. Likewise,  init 0 is an alias for the  halt command.
#                        
# 
#                          There are a number of directories under /etc/rc.dthat look like rc?.d(where ? is
#                        the number of the run-level) and rcsysinit.d, all containing a number of symbolic
#                        links. Some begin with a  K , the others begin with an  S , and all of them have two
#                        numbers following the initial letter. The K means to stop (kill) a service and the
#                        S means to start a service. The numbers determine the order in which the scripts
#                        are run, from 00 to 99;the lower the number the earlier it gets executed. When  init switches
#                        to another run-level, the appropriate services are either started or stopped, depending
#                        on the runlevel chosen. 
# 
#                          The real scripts are in /etc/rc.d/init.d. They do the actual work, and the symlinks
#                        all point to them. K links and S links point to the same script in /etc/rc.d/init.d.
#                        This is because the scripts can be called with different parameters like  start,
#                         stop,  restart,  reload, and  status. When a K link is encountered, the appropriate
#                        script is run with the  stopargument. When an S link is encountered, the appropriate
#                        script is run with the  startargument.  
# 
#                          There is one exception to this explanation. Links that start with an S in the rc0.dand
#                        rc6.ddirectories will not cause anything to be started. They will be called with
#                        the parameter  stopto stop something. The logic behind this is that when a user is
#                        going to reboot or halt the system, nothing needs to be started. The system only
#                        needs to be stopped.  
# 
#                          These are descriptions of what the arguments make the scripts do: 
# 
#                start 
# 
#                          The service is started. 
# 
#                stop 
# 
#                          The service is stopped. 
# 
#                restart 
# 
#                          The service is stopped and then started again. 
# 
#                reload 
# 
#                          The configuration of the service is updated. This is used after the configuration
#                        file of a service was modified, when the service does not need to be restarted.

# 
#                          Feel free to modify the way the boot process works (after all, it is your own LFS
#                        system). The files given here are an example of how it can be done. 
#          9.6.3. Udev Bootscripts 
# 
#                          The /etc/rc.d/init.d/udevinitscript starts  udevd , triggers any "coldplug" devices
#                        that have already been created by the kernel and waits for any rules to complete.
#                        The script also unsets the uevent handler from the default of /sbin/hotplug. This
#                        is done because the kernel no longer needs to call out to an external binary. Instead
#                         udevd will listen on a netlink socket for uevents that the kernel raises. 
# 
#                          The  /etc/rc.d/init.d/udev_retry initscript takes care of re-triggering events for
#                        subsystems whose rules may rely on filesystems that are not mounted until the  mountfs script
#                        is run (in particular, /usrand /varmay cause this). This script runs after the  mountfs script,
#                        so those rules (if re-triggered) should succeed the second time around. It is configured
#                        from the /etc/sysconfig/udev_retryfile; any words in this file other than comments
#                        are considered subsystem names to trigger at retry time. To find the subsystem of
#                        a device, use  udevadm info --attribute-walk <device> where <device> is an absolute
#                        path in /dev or /sys such as /dev/sr0 or /sys/class/rtc. 
# 
#                          For information on kernel module loading and udev, see Section 9.3.2.3, "Module
#                        Loading".   
#          9.6.4. Configuring the System Clock  
# 
#                          The setclock script reads the time from the hardware clock, also known as the BIOS
#                        or the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) clock. If the hardware clock
#                        is set to UTC, this script will convert the hardware clock's time to the local time
#                        using the /etc/localtimefile (which tells the  hwclock program which timezone to use).
#                        There is no way to detect whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC, so this
#                        needs to be configured manually. 
# 
#                          The  setclock program is run via udevwhen the kernel detects the hardware capability
#                        upon boot. It can also be run manually with the stop parameter to store the system
#                        time to the CMOS clock. 
# 
#                          If you cannot remember whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC, find out
#                        by running the  hwclock --localtime --showcommand. This will display what the current
#                        time is according to the hardware clock. If this time matches whatever your watch
#                        says, then the hardware clock is set to local time. If the output from  hwclock is
#                        not local time, chances are it is set to UTC time. Verify this by adding or subtracting
#                        the proper amount of hours for the timezone to the time shown by  hwclock . For example,
#                        if you are currently in the MST timezone, which is also known as GMT -0700, add
#                        seven hours to the local time. 
# 
#                          Change the value of the UTCvariable below to a value of  0(zero) if the hardware
#                        clock is  NOT set to UTC time. 
# 
#                          Create a new file /etc/sysconfig/clockby running the following: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/clock << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/clock
# 
# UTC=1
# 
# # Set this to any options you might need to give to hwclock,
# # such as machine hardware clock type for Alphas.
# CLOCKPARAMS=
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/clock
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          A good hint explaining how to deal with time on LFS is available at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/time.txt.
#                        It explains issues such as time zones, UTC, and the TZenvironment variable.  
#          Note 
# 
#                          The CLOCKPARAMS and UTC paramaters may also be set in the /etc/sysconfig/rc.sitefile.
#                         
#          9.6.5. Configuring the Linux Console  
# 
#                          This section discusses how to configure the console bootscript that sets up the keyboard
#                        map, console font, and console kernel log level. If non-ASCII characters (e.g.,
#                        the copyright sign, the British pound sign and Euro symbol) will not be used and
#                        the keyboard is a U.S. one, much of this section can be skipped. Without the configuration
#                        file, (or equivalent settings in rc.site), the  console bootscript will do nothing.
#                        
# 
#                          The  console script reads the /etc/sysconfig/consolefile for configuration information.
#                        Decide which keymap and screen font will be used. Various language-specific HOWTOs
#                        can also help with this, see http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html.
#                        If still in doubt, look in the /usr/share/keymapsand /usr/share/consolefontsdirectories
#                        for valid keymaps and screen fonts. Read loadkeys(1)and setfont(8)manual pages to
#                        determine the correct arguments for these programs.  
# 
#                          The /etc/sysconfig/consolefile should contain lines of the form: VARIABLE="value".
#                        The following variables are recognized: 
# 
#                LOGLEVEL
# 
#                          This variable specifies the log level for kernel messages sent to the console as
#                        set by  dmesg -n . Valid levels are from "1" (no messages) to "8". The default level
#                        is "7". 
# 
#                KEYMAP
# 
#                          This variable specifies the arguments for the  loadkeys program, typically, the name
#                        of keymap to load, e.g., "it". If this variable is not set, the bootscript will
#                        not run the  loadkeys program, and the default kernel keymap will be used. Note that
#                        a few keymaps have multiple versions with the same name (cz and its variants in
#                        qwerty/ and qwertz/, es in olpc/ and qwerty/, and trf in fgGIod/ and qwerty/). In
#                        these cases the parent directory should also be specified (e.g. qwerty/es) to ensure
#                        the proper keymap is loaded. 
# 
#                KEYMAP_CORRECTIONS
# 
#                          This (rarely used) variable specifies the arguments for the second call to the  loadkeys program.
#                        This is useful if the stock keymap is not completely satisfactory and a small adjustment
#                        has to be made. E.g., to include the Euro sign into a keymap that normally doesn't
#                        have it, set this variable to "euro2". 
# 
#                FONT
# 
#                          This variable specifies the arguments for the  setfont program. Typically, this includes
#                        the font name, "-m", and the name of the application character map to load. E.g.,
#                        in order to load the "lat1-16"font together with the "8859-1"application character
#                        map (as it is appropriate in the USA), set this variable to "lat1-16 -m 8859-1".
#                        In UTF-8 mode, the kernel uses the application character map for conversion of composed
#                        8-bit key codes in the keymap to UTF-8, and thus the argument of the "-m" parameter
#                        should be set to the encoding of the composed key codes in the keymap. 
# 
#                UNICODE
# 
#                          Set this variable to "1", "yes"or "true"in order to put the console into UTF-8 mode.
#                        This is useful in UTF-8 based locales and harmful otherwise. 
# 
#                LEGACY_CHARSET
# 
#                          For many keyboard layouts, there is no stock Unicode keymap in the Kbd package.
#                        The  console bootscript will convert an available keymap to UTF-8 on the fly if this
#                        variable is set to the encoding of the available non-UTF-8 keymap. 
# 
#                          Some examples: 
# 
#                          For a non-Unicode setup, only the KEYMAP and FONT variables are generally needed.
#                        E.g., for a Polish setup, one would use: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/console << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/console
# 
# KEYMAP="pl2"
# FONT="lat2a-16 -m 8859-2"
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/console
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          As mentioned above, it is sometimes necessary to adjust a stock keymap slightly.
#                        The following example adds the Euro symbol to the German keymap: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/console << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/console
# 
# KEYMAP="de-latin1"
# KEYMAP_CORRECTIONS="euro2"
# FONT="lat0-16 -m 8859-15"
# UNICODE="1"
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/console
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          The following is a Unicode-enabled example for Bulgarian, where a stock UTF-8 keymap
#                        exists: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/console << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/console
# 
# UNICODE="1"
# KEYMAP="bg_bds-utf8"
# FONT="LatArCyrHeb-16"
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/console
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          Due to the use of a 512-glyph LatArCyrHeb-16 font in the previous example, bright
#                        colors are no longer available on the Linux console unless a framebuffer is used.
#                        If one wants to have bright colors without a framebuffer and can live without characters
#                        not belonging to his language, it is still possible to use a language-specific 256-glyph
#                        font, as illustrated below: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/console << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/console
# 
# UNICODE="1"
# KEYMAP="bg_bds-utf8"
# FONT="cyr-sun16"
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/console
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          The following example illustrates keymap autoconversion from ISO-8859-15 to UTF-8
#                        and enabling dead keys in Unicode mode: 



# cat > /etc/sysconfig/console << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/sysconfig/console
# 
# UNICODE="1"
# KEYMAP="de-latin1"
# KEYMAP_CORRECTIONS="euro2"
# LEGACY_CHARSET="iso-8859-15"
# FONT="LatArCyrHeb-16 -m 8859-15"
# 
# # End /etc/sysconfig/console
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          Some keymaps have dead keys (i.e., keys that don't produce a character by themselves,
#                        but put an accent on the character produced by the next key) or define composition
#                        rules (such as: "press Ctrl+. A E to get "in the default keymap). Linux-5.10.17
#                        interprets dead keys and composition rules in the keymap correctly only when the
#                        source characters to be composed together are not multibyte. This deficiency doesn't
#                        affect keymaps for European languages, because there accents are added to unaccented
#                        ASCII characters, or two ASCII characters are composed together. However, in UTF-8
#                        mode it is a problem; e.g., for the Greek language, where one sometimes needs to
#                        put an accent on the letter "alpha". The solution is either to avoid the use of
#                        UTF-8, or to install the X window system that doesn't have this limitation in its
#                        input handling. 
# 
#                          For Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and some other languages, the Linux console cannot
#                        be configured to display the needed characters. Users who need such languages should
#                        install the X Window System, fonts that cover the necessary character ranges, and
#                        the proper input method (e.g., SCIM, supports a wide variety of languages). 
#          Note 
# 
#                          The /etc/sysconfig/consolefile only controls the Linux text console localization.
#                        It has nothing to do with setting the proper keyboard layout and terminal fonts
#                        in the X Window System, with ssh sessions, or with a serial console. In such situations,
#                        limitations mentioned in the last two list items above do not apply.  
#          9.6.6. Creating Files at Boot  
# 
#                          At times, it is desirable to create files at boot time. For instance, the /tmp/.ICE-unixdirectory
#                        is often needed. This can be done by creating an entry in the /etc/sysconfig/createfilesconfiguration
#                        script. The format of this file is embedded in the comments of the default configuration
#                        file. 
#          9.6.7. Configuring the sysklogd Script  
# 
#                          The sysklogdscript invokes the syslogd program as a part of System V initialization.
#                        The  -m 0option turns off the periodic timestamp mark that  syslogd writes to the log
#                        files every 20 minutes by default. If you want to turn on this periodic timestamp
#                        mark, edit /etc/sysconfig/rc.siteand define the variable SYSKLOGD_PARMS to the desired
#                        value. For instance, to remove all parameters, set the variable to a null value:
#                        



# SYSKLOGD_PARMS=
# 


# 
#                          See  man syslogdfor more options.  
#          9.6.8. The rc.site File  
# 
#                          The optional /etc/sysconfig/rc.sitefile contains settings that are automatically
#                        set for each SystemV boot script. It can alternatively set the values specified
#                        in the hostname, console, and clockfiles in the /etc/sysconfig/directory. If the
#                        associated variables are present in both these separate files and rc.site, the values
#                        in the script specific files have precedence. 
# 
#                          rc.sitealso contains parameters that can customize other aspects of the boot process.
#                        Setting the IPROMPT variable will enable selective running of bootscripts. Other
#                        options are described in the file comments. The default version of the file is as
#                        follows:

#            9.6.8.1. Customizing the Boot and Shutdown Scripts  
# 
#                          The LFS boot scripts boot and shut down a system in a fairly efficient manner, but
#                        there are a few tweaks that you can make in the rc.site file to improve speed even
#                        more and to adjust messages according to your preferences. To do this, adjust the
#                        settings in the /etc/sysconfig/rc.sitefile above. 
# 
#                          During the boot script udev, there is a call to udev settle that requires some time
#                        to complete. This time may or may not be required depending on devices present in
#                        the system. If you only have simple partitions and a single ethernet card, the boot
#                        process will probably not need to wait for this command. To skip it, set the variable
#                        OMIT_UDEV_SETTLE=y. 
# 
#                          The boot script udev_retryalso runs  udev settle by default. This command is only
#                        needed by default if the /vardirectory is separately mounted. This is because the
#                        clock needs the file /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime. Other customizations may also need
#                        to wait for udev to complete, but in many installations it is not needed. Skip the
#                        command by setting the variable OMIT_UDEV_RETRY_SETTLE=y. 
# 
#                          By default, the file system checks are silent. This can appear to be a delay during
#                        the bootup process. To turn on the  fsck output, set the variable VERBOSE_FSCK=y.
#                        
# 
#                          When rebooting, you may want to skip the filesystem check,  fsck , completely. To
#                        do this, either create the file /fastbootor reboot the system with the command  /sbin/shutdown
#                        -f -r now . On the other hand, you can force all file systems to be checked by creating
#                        /forcefsckor running  shutdown with the  -Fparameter instead of  -f.  
# 
#                          Setting the variable FASTBOOT=y will disable fsck during the boot process until it
#                        is removed. This is not recommended on a permanent basis. 
# 
#                          Normally, all files in the /tmpdirectory are deleted at boot time. Depending on
#                        the number of files or directories present, this can cause a noticeable delay in
#                        the boot process. To skip removing these files set the variable SKIPTMPCLEAN=y.
#                        
# 
#                          During shutdown, the  init program sends a TERM signal to each program it has started
#                        (e.g. agetty), waits for a set time (default 3 seconds), and sends each process
#                        a KILL signal and waits again. This process is repeated in the  sendsignals script
#                        for any processes that are not shut down by their own scripts. The delay for  init can
#                        be set by passing a parameter. For example to remove the delay in  init , pass the
#                        -t0 parameter when shutting down or rebooting (e.g.  /sbin/shutdown -t0 -r now ).
#                        The delay for the  sendsignals script can be skipped by setting the parameter KILLDELAY=0.
#                         
#        9.7. The Bash Shell Startup Files  
# 
#                          The shell program /bin/bash (hereafter referred to as "the shell") uses a collection
#                        of startup files to help create an environment to run in. Each file has a specific
#                        use and may affect login and interactive environments differently. The files in
#                        the /etcdirectory provide global settings. If an equivalent file exists in the home
#                        directory, it may override the global settings. 
# 
#                          An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using  /bin/login ,
#                        by reading the /etc/passwdfile. An interactive non-login shell is started at the
#                        command-line (e.g., [prompt]$ /bin/bash ). A non-interactive shell is usually present
#                        when a shell script is running. It is non-interactive because it is processing a
#                        script and not waiting for user input between commands. 
# 
#                          For more information, see  info bash under the  Bash Startup Files and Interactive
#                        Shells section. 
# 
#                          The files /etc/profileand ~/.bash_profileare read when the shell is invoked as an
#                        interactive login shell. 
# 
#                          The base /etc/profilebelow sets some environment variables necessary for native
#                        language support. Setting them properly results in: 
# 
#                          The output of programs translated into the native language 
# 
#                          Correct classification of characters into letters, digits and other classes. This
#                        is necessary for  bash to properly accept non-ASCII characters in command lines in
#                        non-English locales 
# 
#                          The correct alphabetical sorting order for the country 
# 
#                          Appropriate default paper size 
# 
#                          Correct formatting of monetary, time, and date values 
# 
#                          Replace  <ll>below with the two-letter code for the desired language (e.g., "en")
#                        and   <CC>with the two-letter code for the appropriate country (e.g., "GB").   <charmap>should
#                        be replaced with the canonical charmap for your chosen locale. Optional modifiers
#                        such as "@euro"may also be present.  
# 
#                          The list of all locales supported by Glibc can be obtained by running the following
#                        command: 



# locale -a
# 


# 
#                          Charmaps can have a number of aliases, e.g., "ISO-8859-1"is also referred to as
#                        "iso8859-1"and "iso88591". Some applications cannot handle the various synonyms
#                        correctly (e.g., require that "UTF-8"is written as "UTF-8", not "utf8"), so it is
#                        safest in most cases to choose the canonical name for a particular locale. To determine
#                        the canonical name, run the following command, where  <locale name>is the output
#                        given by  locale -a for your preferred locale ("en_GB.iso88591"in our example). 



# LC_ALL=<locale name> locale charmap
# 

 
# 
#                          For the "en_GB.iso88591"locale, the above command will print: 



# ISO-8859-1
# 


# 
#                          This results in a final locale setting of "en_GB.ISO-8859-1". It is important that
#                        the locale found using the heuristic above is tested prior to it being added to
#                        the Bash startup files: 



# LC_ALL=<locale name> locale language
# LC_ALL=<locale name> locale charmap
# LC_ALL=<locale name> locale int_curr_symbol
# LC_ALL=<locale name> locale int_prefix
# 


# 
#                          The above commands should print the language name, the character encoding used by
#                        the locale, the local currency, and the prefix to dial before the telephone number
#                        in order to get into the country. If any of the commands above fail with a message
#                        similar to the one shown below, this means that your locale was either not installed
#                        in Section 8.5, "Glibc-2.33"or is not supported by the default installation of Glibc.
#                         



# locale: Cannot set LC_* to default locale: No such file or directory
# 


# 
#                          If this happens, you should either install the desired locale using the  localedef command,
#                        or consider choosing a different locale. Further instructions assume that there
#                        are no such error messages from Glibc. 
# 
#                          Other packages can also function incorrectly (but may not necessarily display any
#                        error messages) if the locale name does not meet their expectations. In those cases,
#                        investigating how other Linux distributions support your locale might provide some
#                        useful information. 
# 
#                          Once the proper locale settings have been determined, create the /etc/profilefile:
#                        



# cat > /etc/profile << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/profile
# 
# export LANG=<ll>_<CC>.<charmap><@modifiers>
# 
# # End /etc/profile
# EOF
# 

 
# 
#                          The "C"(default) and "en_US.utf8"(the recommended one for United States English
#                        users) locales are different. "C"uses the US-ASCII 7-bit character set, and treats
#                        bytes with the high bit set as invalid characters. That's why, e.g., the  ls command
#                        substitutes them with question marks in that locale. Also, an attempt to send mail
#                        with such characters from Mutt or Pine results in non-RFC-conforming messages being
#                        sent (the charset in the outgoing mail is indicated as "unknown 8-bit"). So you
#                        can use the "C"locale only if you are sure that you will never need 8-bit characters.
#                        
# 
#                          UTF-8 based locales are not supported well by some programs. Work is in progress
#                        to document and, if possible, fix such problems, see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/10.1/introduction/locale-issues.html.
#                          
#        9.8. Creating the /etc/inputrc File  
# 
#                          The inputrcfile is the configuration file for the readline library, which provides
#                        editing capabilities while the user is entering a line from the terminal. It works
#                        by translating keyboard inputs into specific actions. Readline is used by bash and
#                        most other shells as well as many other applications. 
# 
#                          Most people do not need user-specific functionality so the command below creates
#                        a global /etc/inputrcused by everyone who logs in. If you later decide you need
#                        to override the defaults on a per user basis, you can create a .inputrcfile in the
#                        user's home directory with the modified mappings. 
# 
#                          For more information on how to edit the inputrcfile, see info bash under the  Readline
#                        Init File section.  info readline is also a good source of information. 
# 
#                          Below is a generic global inputrcalong with comments to explain what the various
#                        options do. Note that comments cannot be on the same line as commands. Create the
#                        file using the following command: 



# cat > /etc/inputrc << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/inputrc
# # Modified by Chris Lynn <roryo@roryo.dynup.net>
# 
# # Allow the command prompt to wrap to the next line
# set horizontal-scroll-mode Off
# 
# # Enable 8bit input
# set meta-flag On
# set input-meta On
# 
# # Turns off 8th bit stripping
# set convert-meta Off
# 
# # Keep the 8th bit for display
# set output-meta On
# 
# # none, visible or audible
# set bell-style none
# 
# # All of the following map the escape sequence of the value
# # contained in the 1st argument to the readline specific functions
# "\eOd": backward-word
# "\eOc": forward-word
# 
# # for linux console
# "\e[1~": beginning-of-line
# "\e[4~": end-of-line
# "\e[5~": beginning-of-history
# "\e[6~": end-of-history
# "\e[3~": delete-char
# "\e[2~": quoted-insert
# 
# # for xterm
# "\eOH": beginning-of-line
# "\eOF": end-of-line
# 
# # for Konsole
# "\e[H": beginning-of-line
# "\e[F": end-of-line
# 
# # End /etc/inputrc
# EOF
# 

 
#        9.9. Creating the /etc/shells File  
# 
#                          The shellsfile contains a list of login shells on the system. Applications use this
#                        file to determine whether a shell is valid. For each shell a single line should
#                        be present, consisting of the shell's path relative to the root of the directory
#                        structure (/). 
# 
#                          For example, this file is consulted by chsh to determine whether an unprivileged
#                        user may change the login shell for her own account. If the command name is not
#                        listed, the user will be denied the ability to change shells. 
# 
#                          It is a requirement for applications such as GDMwhich does not populate the face
#                        browser if it can't find /etc/shells, or FTP daemons which traditionally disallow
#                        access to users with shells not included in this file. 



# cat > /etc/shells << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/shells
# 
# /bin/sh
# /bin/bash
# 
# # End /etc/shells
# EOF

#        Chapter 10. Making the LFS System Bootable  
#        10.1. Introduction  
# 
#                          It is time to make the LFS system bootable. This chapter discusses creating the
#                        /etc/fstabfile, building a kernel for the new LFS system, and installing the GRUB
#                        boot loader so that the LFS system can be selected for booting at startup. 
#        10.2. Creating the /etc/fstab File  
# 
#                          The /etc/fstabfile is used by some programs to determine where file systems are
#                        to be mounted by default, in which order, and which must be checked (for integrity
#                        errors) prior to mounting. Create a new file systems table like this: 



# cat > /etc/fstab << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/fstab
# 
# # file system  mount-point  type     options             dump  fsck
# #                                                              order
# 
# /dev/<xxx>     /            <fff>    defaults            1     1
# /dev/<yyy>     swap         swap     pri=1               0     0
# proc           /proc        proc     nosuid,noexec,nodev 0     0
# sysfs          /sys         sysfs    nosuid,noexec,nodev 0     0
# devpts         /dev/pts     devpts   gid=5,mode=620      0     0
# tmpfs          /run         tmpfs    defaults            0     0
# devtmpfs       /dev         devtmpfs mode=0755,nosuid    0     0
# 
# # End /etc/fstab
# EOF
# 

 
# 
#                          Replace <xxx>,  <yyy>, and  <fff>with the values appropriate for the system, for example,
#                        sda2, sda5, and ext4. For details on the six fields in this file, see  man 5 fstab .
#                        
# 
#                          Filesystems with MS-DOS or Windows origin (i.e. vfat, ntfs, smbfs, cifs, iso9660,
#                        udf) need a special option, utf8, in order for non-ASCII characters in file names
#                        to be interpreted properly. For non-UTF-8 locales, the value of iocharsetshould
#                        be set to be the same as the character set of the locale, adjusted in such a way
#                        that the kernel understands it. This works if the relevant character set definition
#                        (found under File systems -> Native Language Support when configuring the kernel)
#                        has been compiled into the kernel or built as a module. However, if the character
#                        set of the locale is UTF-8, the corresponding option iocharset=utf8would make the
#                        file system case sensitive. To fix this, use the special option utf8instead of iocharset=utf8,
#                        for UTF-8 locales. The "codepage"option is also needed for vfat and smbfs filesystems.
#                        It should be set to the codepage number used under MS-DOS in your country. For example,
#                        in order to mount USB flash drives, a ru_RU.KOI8-R user would need the following
#                        in the options portion of its mount line in /etc/fstab: 



# noauto,user,quiet,showexec,codepage=866,iocharset=koi8r
# 


# 
#                          The corresponding options fragment for ru_RU.UTF-8 users is: 



# noauto,user,quiet,showexec,codepage=866,utf8
# 


# 
#                          Note that using iocharsetis the default for iso8859-1(which keeps the file system
#                        case insensitive), and the utf8option tells the kernel to convert the file names
#                        using UTF-8 so they can be interpreted in the UTF-8 locale. 
# 
#                          It is also possible to specify default codepage and iocharset values for some filesystems
#                        during kernel configuration. The relevant parameters are named "Default NLS Option"(CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT),
#                        "Default Remote NLS Option"(CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT), "Default codepage for FAT"(CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE),
#                        and "Default iocharset for FAT"(CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET). There is no way to
#                        specify these settings for the ntfs filesystem at kernel compilation time. 
# 
#                          It is possible to make the ext3 filesystem reliable across power failures for some
#                        hard disk types. To do this, add the barrier=1mount option to the appropriate entry
#                        in /etc/fstab. To check if the disk drive supports this option, run hdparmon the
#                        applicable disk drive. For example, if:  



# hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep NCQ
# 


# 
#                          returns non-empty output, the option is supported. 
# 
#                          Note: Logical Volume Management (LVM) based partitions cannot use the barrieroption.
#                         
#        10.3. Linux-5.10.17  
# 
#                          The Linux package contains the Linux kernel. 
#           Approximate build time: 5.0 - 125.0 SBU (typically about 9 SBU)
#           Required disk space: 1200 - 6750 MB (typically about 1500 MB)
#          10.3.1. Installation of the kernel 
# 
#                          Building the kernel involves a few steps;configuration, compilation, and installation.
#                        Read the READMEfile in the kernel source tree for alternative methods to the way
#                        this book configures the kernel. 
# 
#                          Prepare for compilation by running the following command: 



# make mrproper
# 


# 
#                          This ensures that the kernel tree is absolutely clean. The kernel team recommends
#                        that this command be issued prior to each kernel compilation. Do not rely on the
#                        source tree being clean after un-tarring. 
# 
#                          There are several ways to configure the kernel options. Usually, This is done through
#                        a menu-driven interface, for example: 



# make menuconfig
# 

 
# 
#                          The meaning of optional make environment variables: 
# 
#                LANG=<host_LANG_value> LC_ALL= 
# 
#                          This establishes the locale setting to the one used on the host. This may be needed
#                        for a proper menuconfig ncurses interface line drawing on a UTF-8 linux text console.
#                        
# 
#                          If used, be sure to replace  <host_LANG_value>by the value of the $LANGvariable from
#                        your host. You can alternatively use instead the host's value of $LC_ALLor $LC_CTYPE.
#                         
# 
#                
#           make menuconfig 
# 
#                          This launches an ncurses menu-driven interface. For other (graphical) interfaces,
#                        type  make help . 
# 
#                          For general information on kernel configuration see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/kernel-configuration.txt.
#                        BLFS has some information regarding particular kernel configuration requirements
#                        of packages outside of LFS at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/10.1/longindex.html#kernel-config-index.
#                        Additional information about configuring and building the kernel can be found at
#                        http://www.kroah.com/lkn/  
#          Note 
# 
#                          A good starting place for setting up the kernel configuration is to run make defconfig .
#                        This will set the base configuration to a good state that takes your current system
#                        architecture into account. 
# 
#                          Be sure to enable/disable/set the following features or the system might not work
#                        correctly or boot at all: 



# Device Drivers  --->
#   Generic Driver Options  --->
#    [ ] Support for uevent helper [CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER]
#    [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev [CONFIG_DEVTMPFS]
# 


# 
#                          There are several other options that may be desired depending on the requirements
#                        for the system. For a list of options needed for BLFS packages, see the BLFS Index
#                        of Kernel Settings(http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/10.1/longindex.html#kernel-config-index).
#                         
#          Note 
# 
#                          If your host hardware is using UEFI, then the 'make defconfig' above should automatically
#                        add in some EFI-related kernel options. 
# 
#                          In order to allow your LFS kernel to be booted from within your host's UEFI boot
#                        environment, your kernel must have this option selected: 



# Processor type and features  --->
#    [*]   EFI stub support  [CONFIG_EFI_STUB]
# 


# 
#                          A fuller description of managing UEFI environments from within LFS is covered by
#                        the lfs-uefi.txt hint at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs-uefi.txt.
#                          
# 
#                          The rationale for the above configuration items: 
# 
#                Support for uevent helper 
# 
#                          Having this option set may interfere with device management when using Udev/Eudev.
#                        
# 
#                Maintain a devtmpfs 
# 
#                          This will create automated device nodes which are populated by the kernel, even
#                        without Udev running. Udev then runs on top of this, managing permissions and adding
#                        symlinks. This configuration item is required for all users of Udev/Eudev. 
# 
#                          Alternatively,  make oldconfig may be more appropriate in some situations. See the
#                        READMEfile for more information. 
# 
#                          If desired, skip kernel configuration by copying the kernel config file, .config,
#                        from the host system (assuming it is available) to the unpacked linux-5.10.17directory.
#                        However, we do not recommend this option. It is often better to explore all the
#                        configuration menus and create the kernel configuration from scratch. 
# 
#                          Compile the kernel image and modules: 



# make
# 


# 
#                          If using kernel modules, module configuration in /etc/modprobe.dmay be required.
#                        Information pertaining to modules and kernel configuration is located in Section
#                        9.3, "Overview of Device and Module Handling"and in the kernel documentation in
#                        the linux-5.10.17/Documentationdirectory. Also, modprobe.d(5)may be of interest.
#                         
# 
#                          Unless module support has been disabled in the kernel configuration, install the
#                        modules with: 



# make modules_install
# 


# 
#                          After kernel compilation is complete, additional steps are required to complete
#                        the installation. Some files need to be copied to the /bootdirectory. 
#          Caution 
# 
#                          If the host system has a separate /boot partition, the files copied below should
#                        go there. The easiest way to do that is to bind /boot on the host (outside chroot)
#                        to /mnt/lfs/boot before proceeding. As the root user in the  host system : 



# mount --bind /boot /mnt/lfs/boot
# 


# 
#                          The path to the kernel image may vary depending on the platform being used. The
#                        filename below can be changed to suit your taste, but the stem of the filename should
#                        be  vmlinuz to be compatible with the automatic setup of the boot process described
#                        in the next section. The following command assumes an x86 architecture: 



# cp -iv arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-5.10.17-lfs-10.1
# 

 
# 
#                          System.mapis a symbol file for the kernel. It maps the function entry points of
#                        every function in the kernel API, as well as the addresses of the kernel data structures
#                        for the running kernel. It is used as a resource when investigating kernel problems.
#                        Issue the following command to install the map file: 



# cp -iv System.map /boot/System.map-5.10.17
# 


# 
#                          The kernel configuration file .configproduced by the make menuconfig step above contains
#                        all the configuration selections for the kernel that was just compiled. It is a
#                        good idea to keep this file for future reference: 



# cp -iv .config /boot/config-5.10.17
# 


# 
#                          Install the documentation for the Linux kernel: 



# install -d /usr/share/doc/linux-5.10.17
# cp -r Documentation/* /usr/share/doc/linux-5.10.17
# 


# 
#                          It is important to note that the files in the kernel source directory are not owned
#                        by  root . Whenever a package is unpacked as user  root (like we did inside chroot),
#                        the files have the user and group IDs of whatever they were on the packager's computer.
#                        This is usually not a problem for any other package to be installed because the
#                        source tree is removed after the installation. However, the Linux source tree is
#                        often retained for a long time. Because of this, there is a chance that whatever
#                        user ID the packager used will be assigned to somebody on the machine. That person
#                        would then have write access to the kernel source. 
#          Note 
# 
#                          In many cases, the configuration of the kernel will need to be updated for packages
#                        that will be installed later in BLFS. Unlike other packages, it is not necessary
#                        to remove the kernel source tree after the newly built kernel is installed. 
# 
#                          If the kernel source tree is going to be retained, run  chown -R 0:0 on the linux-5.10.17directory
#                        to ensure all files are owned by user  root . 
#          Warning 
# 
#                          Some kernel documentation recommends creating a symlink from /usr/src/linuxpointing
#                        to the kernel source directory. This is specific to kernels prior to the 2.6 series
#                        and  must not be created on an LFS system as it can cause problems for packages you
#                        may wish to build once your base LFS system is complete. 
#          Warning 
# 
#                          The headers in the system's includedirectory (/usr/include) should  always be the
#                        ones against which Glibc was compiled, that is, the sanitised headers installed
#                        in Section 5.4, "Linux-5.10.17 API Headers". Therefore, they should   never be replaced
#                        by either the raw kernel headers or any other kernel sanitized headers.  
#          10.3.2. Configuring Linux Module Load Order  
# 
#                          Most of the time Linux modules are loaded automatically, but sometimes it needs
#                        some specific direction. The program that loads modules, modprobe or  insmod , uses
#                        /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conffor this purpose. This file needs to be created so that
#                        if the USB drivers (ehci_hcd, ohci_hcd and uhci_hcd) have been built as modules,
#                        they will be loaded in the correct order; ehci_hcd needs to be loaded prior to ohci_hcd
#                        and uhci_hcd in order to avoid a warning being output at boot time. 
# 
#                          Create a new file /etc/modprobe.d/usb.confby running the following: 



# install -v -m755 -d /etc/modprobe.d
# cat > /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf << "EOF"
# # Begin /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf
# 
# install ohci_hcd /sbin/modprobe ehci_hcd ; /sbin/modprobe -i ohci_hcd ; true
# install uhci_hcd /sbin/modprobe ehci_hcd ; /sbin/modprobe -i uhci_hcd ; true
# 
# # End /etc/modprobe.d/usb.conf
# EOF
#

# 
#                          The engine of the Linux system. When turning on the computer, the kernel is the
#                        first part of the operating system that gets loaded. It detects and initializes
#                        all components of the computer's hardware, then makes these components available
#                        as a tree of files to the software and turns a single CPU into a multitasking machine
#                        capable of running scores of programs seemingly at the same time  
# 
#                          System.map-5.10.17 
# 
#                          A list of addresses and symbols; it maps the entry points and addresses of all the
#                        functions and data structures in the kernel 
#        10.4. Using GRUB to Set Up the Boot Process  
#          10.4.1. Introduction 
#          Warning 
# 
#                          Configuring GRUB incorrectly can render your system inoperable without an alternate
#                        boot device such as a CD-ROM or bootable USB drive. This section is not required
#                        to boot your LFS system. You may just want to modify your current boot loader, e.g.
#                        Grub-Legacy, GRUB2, or LILO. 
# 
#                          Ensure that an emergency boot disk is ready to "rescue"the computer if the computer
#                        becomes unusable (un-bootable). If you do not already have a boot device, you can
#                        create one. In order for the procedure below to work, you need to jump ahead to
#                        BLFS and install  xorrisofrom the libisoburnpackage.   



# cd /tmp 
# grub-mkrescue --output=grub-img.iso 
# xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/cdrw blank=as_needed grub-img.iso
# 


#          Note 
# 
#                          To boot LFS on host systems that have UEFI enabled, the kernel needs to have been
#                        built with the CONFIG_EFI_STUB capability described in the previous section. However,
#                        LFS can be booted using GRUB2 without such an addition. To do this, the UEFI Mode
#                        and Secure Boot capabilities in the host system's BIOS need to be turned off. For
#                        details, see the lfs-uefi.txt hintat http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfs-uefi.txt.
#                         
#          10.4.2. GRUB Naming Conventions 
# 
#                          GRUB uses its own naming structure for drives and partitions in the form of (hdn,m) ,
#                        where  n is the hard drive number and  m is the partition number. The hard drive number
#                        starts from zero, but the partition number starts from one for normal partitions
#                        and five for extended partitions. Note that this is different from earlier versions
#                        where both numbers started from zero. For example, partition sda1is  (hd0,1) to GRUB
#                        and sdb3is  (hd1,3) . In contrast to Linux, GRUB does not consider CD-ROM drives to
#                        be hard drives. For example, if using a CD on hdband a second hard drive on hdc,
#                        that second hard drive would still be  (hd1) . 
#          10.4.3. Setting Up the Configuration 
# 
#                          GRUB works by writing data to the first physical track of the hard disk. This area
#                        is not part of any file system. The programs there access GRUB modules in the boot
#                        partition. The default location is /boot/grub/. 
# 
#                          The location of the boot partition is a choice of the user that affects the configuration.
#                        One recommendation is to have a separate small (suggested size is 200 MB) partition
#                        just for boot information. That way each build, whether LFS or some commercial distro,
#                        can access the same boot files and access can be made from any booted system. If
#                        you choose to do this, you will need to mount the separate partition, move all files
#                        in the current /bootdirectory (e.g. the linux kernel you just built in the previous
#                        section) to the new partition. You will then need to unmount the partition and remount
#                        it as /boot. If you do this, be sure to update /etc/fstab. 
# 
#                          Using the current lfs partition will also work, but configuration for multiple systems
#                        is more difficult. 
# 
#                          Using the above information, determine the appropriate designator for the root partition
#                        (or boot partition, if a separate one is used). For the following example, it is
#                        assumed that the root (or separate boot) partition is sda2. 
# 
#                          Install the GRUB files into /boot/gruband set up the boot track: 
#          Warning 
# 
#                          The following command will overwrite the current boot loader. Do not run the command
#                        if this is not desired, for example, if using a third party boot manager to manage
#                        the Master Boot Record (MBR). 



# grub-install /dev/sda
# 


#          Note 
# 
#                          If the system has been booted using UEFI,  grub-install will try to install files
#                        for the  x86_64-efi target, but those files have not been installed in chapter 6.
#                        If this is the case, add --target i386-pcto the command above.  
#          10.4.4. Creating the GRUB Configuration File  
# 
#                          Generate /boot/grub/grub.cfg: 



# cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << "EOF"
# # Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# set default=0
# set timeout=5
# 
# insmod ext2
# set root=(hd0,2)
# 
# menuentry "GNU/Linux, Linux 5.10.17-lfs-10.1" {
#         linux   /boot/vmlinuz-5.10.17-lfs-10.1 root=/dev/sda2 ro
# }
# EOF
# 


#          Note 
# 
#                          From GRUB's perspective, the kernel files are relative to the partition used. If
#                        you used a separate /boot partition, remove /boot from the above  linux line. You
#                        will also need to change the  set root line to point to the boot partition. 
# 
#                          GRUB is an extremely powerful program and it provides a tremendous number of options
#                        for booting from a wide variety of devices, operating systems, and partition types.
#                        There are also many options for customization such as graphical splash screens,
#                        playing sounds, mouse input, etc. The details of these options are beyond the scope
#                        of this introduction. 
#          Caution 
# 
#                          There is a command, grub-mkconfig, that can write a configuration file automatically.
#                        It uses a set of scripts in /etc/grub.d/ and will destroy any customizations that
#                        you make. These scripts are designed primarily for non-source distributions and
#                        are not recommended for LFS. If you install a commercial Linux distribution, there
#                        is a good chance that this program will be run. Be sure to back up your grub.cfg
#                        file.  
#        Chapter 11. The End  
#        11.1. The End  
# 
#                          Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much success with your shiny
#                        new custom-built Linux system. 
# 
#                          It may be a good idea to create an /etc/lfs-releasefile. By having this file, it
#                        is very easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find
#                        out which LFS version is installed on the system. Create this file by running: 



# echo 10.1 > /etc/lfs-release
# 


# 
#                          Two files describing the installed system may be used by packages that can be installed
#                        on the system later, either in binary form or by building them. 
# 
#                          The first one shows the status of your new system with respect to the Linux Standards
#                        Base (LSB). To create this file, run: 



# cat > /etc/lsb-release << "EOF"
# DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
# DISTRIB_RELEASE="10.1"
# DISTRIB_CODENAME="<your name here>"
# DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          The second one contains roughly the same information, and is used by systemd and
#                        some graphical desktop environments. To create this file, run: 



# cat > /etc/os-release << "EOF"
# NAME="Linux From Scratch"
# VERSION="10.1"
# ID=lfs
# PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch 10.1"
# VERSION_CODENAME="<your name here>"
# EOF
# 


# 
#                          Be sure to put some sort of customization for the fields 'DISTRIB_CODENAME' and
#                        'VERSION_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely yours. 
#        11.2. Get Counted  
# 
#                          Now that you have finished the book, do you want to be counted as an LFS user? Head
#                        over to http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/cgi-bin/lfscounter.phpand register as an
#                        LFS user by entering your name and the first LFS version you have used.  
# 
#                          Let's reboot into LFS now. 
#        11.3. Rebooting the System  
# 
#                          Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot your computer.
#                        However, you should be aware of a few things. The system you have created in this
#                        book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have the functionality you would
#                        need to be able to continue forward. By installing a few extra packages from the
#                        BLFS book while still in our current chroot environment, you can leave yourself
#                        in a much better position to continue on once you reboot into your new LFS installation.
#                        Here are some suggestions: 
# 
#                          A text mode browser such as Lynxwill allow you to easily view the BLFS book in one
#                        virtual terminal, while building packages in another.  
# 
#                          The GPMpackage will allow you to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual terminals.
#                         
# 
#                          If you are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet your networking
#                        requirements, installing a package such as dhcpcdor the client portion of dhcpmay
#                        be useful.  
# 
#                          Installing sudomay be useful for building packages as a non-root user and easily
#                        installing the resulting packages in your new system.  
# 
#                          If you want to access your new system from a remote system within a comfortable
#                        GUI environment, install openssh.  
# 
#                          To make fetching files over the internet easier, install wget.  
# 
#                          Finally, a review of the following configuration files is also appropriate at this
#                        point. 
# 
#                          /etc/bashrc 
# 
#                          /etc/dircolors 
# 
#                          /etc/fstab 
# 
#                          /etc/hosts 
# 
#                          /etc/inputrc 
# 
#                          /etc/profile 
# 
#                          /etc/resolv.conf 
# 
#                          /etc/vimrc 
# 
#                          /root/.bash_profile 
# 
#                          /root/.bashrc 
# 
#                          /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 
# 
#                          Now that we have said that, let's move on to booting our shiny new LFS installation
#                        for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment: 



# logout
# 


# 
#                          Unmount the LFS file system hierarchy: 



# umount -Rv $LFS
# 


# 
#                          Now, reboot the system with: 



# shutdown -r now
# 


# 
#                          Assuming the GRUB boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu is set to
#                        boot LFS 10.1 automatically. 
# 
#                          When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and more software may
#                        be added to suit your needs.  
#        11.4. What Now?  
# 
#                          Thank you for reading this LFS book. We hope that you have found this book helpful
#                        and have learned more about the system creation process. 
# 
#                          Now that the LFS system is installed, you may be wondering "What next?"To answer
#                        that question, we have compiled a list of resources for you.

#                          Maintenance 
# 
#                          Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all software. Since an LFS
#                        system is compiled from source, it is up to you to keep abreast of such reports.
#                        There are several online resources that track such reports, some of which are shown

#        Appendix C. Dependencies  
# 
#                          Every package built in LFS relies on one or more other packages in order to build
#                        and install properly. Some packages even participate in circular dependencies, that
#                        is, the first package depends on the second which in turn depends on the first.
#                        Because of these dependencies, the order in which packages are built in LFS is very
#                        important. The purpose of this page is to document the dependencies of each package
#                        built in LFS.

#                          For each package we build, we have listed three, and sometimes four, types of dependencies.
#                        The first lists what other packages need to be available in order to compile and
#                        install the package in question. The second lists what packages, in addition to
#                        those on the first list, need to be available in order to run the test suites. The
#                        third list of dependencies are packages that require this package to be built and
#                        installed in its final location before they are built and installed. In most cases,
#                        this is because these packages will hard code paths to binaries within their scripts.
#                        If not built in a certain order, this could result in paths of /tools/bin/[binary]
#                        being placed inside scripts installed to the final system. This is obviously not
#                        desirable. 
# 
#                          The last list of dependencies are optional packages that are not addressed in LFS,
#                        but could be useful to the user. These packages may have additional mandatory or
#                        optional dependencies of their own. For these dependencies, the recommended practice
#                        is to install them after completion of the LFS book and then go back and rebuild
#                        the LFS package. In several cases, re-installation is addressed in BLFS.

# 
#                          The scripts in this appendix are listed by the directory where they normally reside.
#                        The order is /etc/rc.d/init.d, /etc/sysconfig, /etc/sysconfig/network-devices, and
#                        /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/services. Within each section, the files are listed
#                        in the order they are normally called. 
#        D.1. /etc/rc.d/init.d/rc  
# 
#                          The rcscript is the first script called by initand initiates the boot process.

#                        BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE

# 
#                          Definitions 
# 
#                          "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia,
#                        in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
#                        contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled
#                        into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered
#                        a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. 
# 
#                          "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing
#                        works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
#                        motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation,
#                        or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except
#                        that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative
#                        Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
#                        is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
#                        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative
#                        Work for the purpose of this License. 
# 
#                          "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of
#                        this License. 
# 
#                          "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. 
# 
#                          "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
#                        License. 
# 
#                          "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
#                        not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who
#                        has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
#                        License despite a previous violation. 
# 
#                          "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected
#                        by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, Noncommercial,
#                        ShareAlike. 
# 
#                          Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
#                        any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive
#                        rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. 
# 
#                          License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
#                        grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration
#                        of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
#                        below: 
# 
#                          to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works,
#                        and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 
# 
#                          to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 
# 
#                          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
#                        perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
#                        incorporated in Collective Works; 
# 
#                          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
#                        perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works; 
# 
#                          The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
#                        hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
#                        as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
#                        All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but
#                        not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f). 
# 
#                          Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
#                        and limited by the following restrictions: 
# 
#                          You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
#                        the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or
#                        the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord
#                        of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
#                        perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
#                        the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder.
#                        You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
#                        this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
#                        display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
#                        measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
#                        terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in
#                        a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
#                        Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
#                        Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
#                        from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author,
#                        as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
#                        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to
#                        such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. 
# 
#                          You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
#                        a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this
#                        License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
#                        license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike
#                        2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
#                        this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy
#                        or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
#                        perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
#                        the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
#                        exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that
#                        refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
#                        publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative
#                        Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
#                        manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies
#                        to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
#                        the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to
#                        the terms of this License. 
# 
#                          You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
#                        manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
#                        private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works
#                        by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended
#                        for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
#                        there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
#                        of copyrighted works. 
# 
#                          If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
#                        the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
#                        notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium
#                        or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of
#                        the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
#                        reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies
#                        to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
#                        notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
#                        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation
#                        of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
#                        Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
#                        that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
#                        will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
#                        at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 
# 
#                          For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: 
# 
#                          Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right
#                        to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP,
#                        BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance
#                        (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed
#                        toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 
# 
#                          Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right
#                        to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent
#                        (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
#                        ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
#                        USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions),
#                        if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed
#                        toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 6. Webcasting Rights
#                        and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording,
#                        Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
#                        performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
#                        performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created
#                        by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions),
#                        if Your public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
#                        commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 
# 
#                          Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
#                        Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
#                        individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties
#                        for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory
#                        license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent
#                        in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily intended
#                        for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. 
# 
#                          Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer 
# 
#                          UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE
#                        WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
#                        WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
#                        OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR
#                        THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
#                        ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
#                        OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
# 
#                          Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO
#                        EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
#                        CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE
#                        USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
#                        
# 
#                          Termination 
# 
#                          This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
#                        any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
#                        received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,

#                        and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. 
# 
#                          Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor

#                        it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
#                        of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
#                        provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
#                        valid and enforceable. 
# 
#                          No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented

#                        be charged with such waiver or consent.

#                          This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
#                        the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations
